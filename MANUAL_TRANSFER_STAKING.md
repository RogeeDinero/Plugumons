# ✅ Manual Transfer Staking - Simplified & Working!

## 🎯 New Approach: Manual Transfer + Signature

Instead of complex automated transfers that were failing, we've switched to a **simpler, more reliable** approach that's commonly used in DeFi:

### How It Works:

1. User initiates stake on website
2. Gets staking wallet address
3. Manually sends PLUGU from their wallet
4. Returns with transaction signature
5. Stake activates!

**This is actually MORE secure and gives users full control!**

## 🔄 User Flow

### Step 1: User Clicks "Start Staking"
```
Enter: 1,000 PLUGU for 90 days
Click: "Start Staking"
```

### Step 2: Confirmation Dialog
```
🔒 STAKE 1,000 $PLUGU FOR 90 DAYS

STEP 1: Transfer 1,000 PLUGU tokens to:

STEP 2: After transfer, come back and enter your 
transaction signature to activate your stake.

⚠️ Important:

### Step 3: Address Display & Copy

### Step 4: User Transfers in Wallet
User goes to their wallet (Phantom/Solflare/Backpack):
1. Opens "Send" or "Transfer"
2. Pastes staking address
3. Selects PLUGU token
4. Enters amount (1,000)
5. Confirms transaction
6. Copies transaction signature

### Step 5: Signature Input (Auto-prompts after 2 seconds)

If you've sent 1,000 PLUGU to the staking wallet, 
paste your TRANSACTION SIGNATURE below to activate your stake:
