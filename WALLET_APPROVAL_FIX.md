# ✅ Wallet Approval Flow - Fixed!

## 🐛 What Was Wrong

### Problems:
1. ❌ Too many `alert()` popups blocking the flow
2. ❌ Public Solana RPC giving 403 errors (rate limiting)
3. ❌ "Processing" alert preventing wallet popup from showing
4. ❌ Wallet approval should happen automatically, not through alerts

### User Experience Before:
```
Click "Start Staking"
  ↓
Alert #1: "Stake 1,000 PLUGU?" → Click OK
  ↓
Alert #2: "Processing..." → Click OK  ❌ (Blocks wallet!)
  ↓
ERROR: 403 Forbidden (RPC blocked)
  ↓
Alert #3: "Failed to stake" 😞
```

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. Removed Blocking Alerts
**Before:**
```javascript
alert('Processing your stake...');  // ❌ Blocks wallet popup
await signTransaction();
```

**After:**
```javascript
// No alert - wallet popup appears immediately ✅
await signTransaction();
```

### 2. Fixed RPC Endpoint Issues
**Before:**
```javascript
// Single endpoint - fails if rate limited
const connection = new Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Multiple endpoints with fallback ✅
const RPC_ENDPOINTS = [
    'https://solana-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/alcht_demo',
    'https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com',
    'https://solana-api.projectserum.com'
];

// Tries each until one works
for (const endpoint of RPC_ENDPOINTS) {
    try {
        connection = new Connection(endpoint, 'confirmed');
        await connection.getLatestBlockhash(); // Test it
        break; // Success!
    } catch {
        continue; // Try next
    }
}
```

### 3. Better Error Messages
**Before:**
```
Error: 403 : {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":403, "message":"Access forbidden"}}
```

**After:**
```
❌ Network Connection Issue

Unable to connect to Solana network. This is usually temporary.

Please try again in a few moments.
```

### 4. Simplified Confirmation
**Before:**
```
Confirm → Alert "Processing" → Alert "Transaction sent" → Result
```

**After:**
```
Confirm → Wallet Popup (automatic) → Result
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### File: `energy-grid.html`

**Removed:**
- ❌ `alert('Processing your stake...')` - Was blocking wallet popup
- ❌ `alert('Transaction sent!')` - Unnecessary, wallet shows this
- ❌ Single RPC endpoint - Was getting rate limited

**Added:**
- ✅ Multiple RPC endpoints with automatic fallback
- ✅ Better error detection and messages
- ✅ Direct flow to wallet approval
- ✅ Connection testing before use

---

## 🌐 RPC Endpoints Used

### Priority Order:
1. **Alchemy Public** - `https://solana-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/alcht_demo`
   - Good for testing
   - Free tier available

2. **Solana Official** - `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`
   - Official endpoint
   - Can be rate limited

3. **Serum** - `https://solana-api.projectserum.com`
   - Community endpoint
   - Backup option

**System tries each one until it finds one that works!**
