The AI engineer successfully transitioned a basic HTML/JS/Express application into a functional, albeit custodial, staking platform. Initial tasks focused on integrating the  page, setting up an Express backend with SQLite for stake management, and handling Solana wallet connections (Phantom, Solflare). Key decisions involved using a Node.js/Express backend for API endpoints, storing staking data in SQLite, and managing environment variables for Solana RPC and the reward wallet.

A significant pivot occurred when the user explicitly requested a smart contract system instead of the implemented custodial approach. The AI began structuring a Solana Anchor program, creating initial files like , , and . However, the current state indicates an incomplete Anchor project structure, specifically a missing  in the main program directory, which is essential for building. Deployment and DNS issues with Render and GoDaddy were also resolved, ensuring the  URL functions correctly, and a  subdomain was set up for the smart contract integration.

The user aims to launch a staking platform for their PLUGU token (contract: ) on plugumons.com, distributing rewards from wallet .
Key features include:
- Re-enabling the Energy Grid button to .
- Direct wallet connection for Phantom, Solflare, and Backpack users.
- Three locked staking options for non-NFT holders: 30-day (5% APR), 90-day (10% APR), 365-day (20% APR).
- NFT holder benefits (token address: ):
    - No locked staking; unstake anytime.
    - x2 APR multiplier at halfway mark (e.g., 30-day at 10% APR, 90-day at 20% APR, 365-day at 40% APR).
- Accurate reward calculator.
- Removal of hypothetical frontend data, replaced with real-time tracking for total staked, user's stake, active stakers, user's power stations, and overall power grid percentage.
- Power grid: Reaches 100% at 200,000,000 PLUGU tokens staked. Once 100%, all APRs double for both NFT/non-NFT holders.
- Functional Claim Rewards, Unstake, and Start Staking buttons.
- Top Power Plants section: Displays top 5 addresses by PLUGU rewards, with amounts, replacing placeholders.
- A Docs button linking to an informative modal explaining staking rules, APRs for NFT/non-NFT holders, grid power, etc.
- The user initially received a custodial staking solution but explicitly requested a non-custodial smart contract system.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of building a Solana smart contract (Anchor program) as requested by the user, moving away from the previously implemented custodial staking system. The AI had created the initial directory  along with several foundational files: ,  (at the root of ), and .

However, the user identified a critical issue with the generated structure, stating: plugumons-staking folder does not have a Cargo.toml file â€” Anchor requires it to build and deploy the program. Right now you only have the src folder. This indicates that while a  exists at the top-level  directory, the specific Anchor program within  is missing its own , which is necessary for Anchor to correctly identify and build the program. The AI acknowledged this, stating it would fix the proper Anchor project structure.
