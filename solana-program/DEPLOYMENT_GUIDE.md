# 🚀 Plugumons Staking Program - Deployment Guide

## ✅ What I've Built For You:

A complete **Solana smart contract (program)** with:
- ✅ Token staking with lock periods (30/90/365 days)
- ✅ Automatic APR calculation (5%/10%/20%)
- ✅ NFT holder benefits (no lock + 2x multiplier)
- ✅ Grid power system (200M target, 2x boost)
- ✅ Automatic reward distribution
- ✅ Secure token custody (no private keys on server!)
- ✅ Fully trustless and decentralized

---

## 📋 What You Need to Deploy:

### Requirements:
1. **Solana CLI** installed
2. **Anchor Framework** installed
3. **Rust** installed
4. **Wallet with SOL** (~5-10 SOL for deployment)
5. **VS Code** or any code editor

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Deployment:

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install Solana CLI
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.17.0/install)"

# Install Anchor
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked --force
avm install latest
avm use latest
```

**On Windows:**
Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and follow Mac/Linux instructions.

---

### Step 2: Setup Project

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/plugumons-staking

# Copy the solana-program folder to your local machine
# (It's in your GitHub repo now)

cd solana-program

# Install dependencies
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

---

### Step 3: Configure Wallet

```bash
# Create a new wallet (or use existing)
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/id.json

# Check your wallet address
solana address

# Fund it with SOL (need 5-10 SOL for deployment)
# Buy SOL on exchange and send to this address
# Or use: solana airdrop 2 (only works on devnet)
```

---

### Step 4: Test on Devnet First

```bash
# Switch to devnet
solana config set --url devnet

# Get devnet SOL (free!)
solana airdrop 2
solana airdrop 2
solana airdrop 2

# Build the program
anchor build

# Deploy to devnet
anchor deploy

# Run tests
anchor test
```

**If tests pass** → Ready for mainnet! ✅

---

### Step 5: Deploy to Mainnet

```bash
# Switch to mainnet
solana config set --url mainnet-beta

# Check balance (need 5-10 SOL)
solana balance

# Build for mainnet
anchor build

# Deploy to mainnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster mainnet

# Copy the Program ID that's output
# Example: Program Id: Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS
```

**🎉 Your program is now LIVE on Solana mainnet!**

---

### Step 6: Initialize the Staking Pool

```bash
# Create initialization script
# This sets up the staking pool

# You'll need to:
# 1. Create token account for staking pool
# 2. Fund it with PLUGU for rewards
# 3. Call initialize instruction

# I'll provide a TypeScript script for this
```

---

## 📝 Post-Deployment Checklist:

- [ ] Program deployed to mainnet
- [ ] Program ID copied
- [ ] Staking pool initialized
- [ ] Pool token account created
- [ ] Pool funded with PLUGU rewards
- [ ] Program ID added to frontend
- [ ] Frontend updated to use program
- [ ] Tested on devnet
- [ ] Tested on mainnet with small amounts

---

## 🔧 Update Frontend to Use Program

After deployment, you need to update your frontend to interact with the smart contract instead of the backend API.

**I'll provide updated frontend code that:**
- Calls the Solana program directly
- Signs transactions with user's wallet
- No backend needed for staking logic!

---

## 💰 Cost Breakdown:

### Deployment Costs:
- Program deployment: ~2-5 SOL (~$400-$1,000)
- Account creation: ~0.01 SOL per user
- Transaction fees: ~0.000005 SOL per transaction

### Ongoing Costs:
- Reward pool funding: Your PLUGU tokens
- No monthly fees!
- No server costs for staking logic!

---

## 🎯 What Happens After Deployment:

### How It Works:

**User Stakes:**
```
1. User clicks "Stake" on website
2. Wallet popup appears
3. User approves transaction
4. Smart contract locks tokens ✅
5. Rewards start accumulating automatically ✅
```

**User Claims/Unstakes:**
```
1. User clicks "Claim" or "Unstake"
2. Smart contract checks:
   - Lock period (unless NFT holder)
   - Calculates rewards
   - Applies bonuses (NFT, grid boost)
3. Automatically sends tokens + rewards ✅
4. No manual work for you! ✅
```

**Grid Power:**
```
- Smart contract tracks total staked
- Automatically activates 2x boost at 200M
- Updates for all stakers instantly
```

---

## 🔐 Security Features:

✅ **No Private Keys on Server**
- Users control their own wallets
- Smart contract holds staked tokens
- Fully decentralized

✅ **Immutable Rules**
- Lock periods enforced on-chain
- APR rates in code
- Can't be changed (unless you build upgrade authority)

✅ **Automatic Everything**
- Reward calculation
- Token distribution
- Lock period enforcement
- No manual work!

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

### Before Mainnet:

1. **Test thoroughly on devnet**
   - Stake, unstake, claim
   - Test all lock periods
   - Test NFT benefits
   - Test grid boost

2. **Consider Security Audit**
   - Recommended for programs holding user funds
   - Cost: $10k-$50k
   - Worth it for peace of mind

3. **Start Small**
   - Launch with caps (max stake per user)
   - Monitor for issues
   - Gradually increase limits

4. **Have Backup Plan**
   - Keep some PLUGU in reserve
   - Monitor program accounts
   - Have emergency contacts

---

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong:

### Common Issues:

**"Insufficient funds"**
→ Need more SOL in wallet for deployment

**"Program already deployed"**
→ Use `anchor upgrade` instead of `anchor deploy`

**"Transaction simulation failed"**
→ Check accounts are correct
→ Check token accounts exist
→ Check authority is correct

**Tests failing**
→ Check devnet SOL balance
→ Check token mint is correct
→ Check all accounts initialized

---

## 📚 Next Steps:

1. **Deploy to devnet** (test environment)
2. **Test everything** thoroughly
3. **Deploy to mainnet** (real)
4. **Initialize staking pool**
5. **Fund reward pool**
6. **Update frontend**
7. **Launch!** 🚀

---
