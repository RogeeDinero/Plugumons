# 🚨 Last Resort Solutions - Build Environment Issues

## Problem Summary

You're encountering multiple issues:
1. ❌ AVM can't install Anchor 0.29.0 (binary conflict)
2. ❌ Cargo.lock v4 persists even with Rust 1.90.0
3. ❌ Docker permission denied

This indicates **fundamental environment incompatibilities** between Anchor, Solana CLI, and Rust.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION 1: Fix AVM and Rebuild (TRY THIS FIRST)

This will completely clean and reinstall Anchor:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/GamingPc/Plugumons
git pull origin main
cd solana-program

chmod +x FIX_AVM_AND_BUILD.sh
./FIX_AVM_AND_BUILD.sh
```

**This script will:**
- Remove all existing Anchor binaries
- Reinstall AVM from scratch
- Install Anchor 0.29.0 cleanly
- Update config files
- Deep clean and rebuild

---

## ✅ SOLUTION 2: Fix Docker and Build There

### A. Fix Docker Permissions

```bash
chmod +x FIX_DOCKER.sh
./FIX_DOCKER.sh

# After running the script, you MUST either:
# Option 1: Log out and log back in to WSL
# Option 2: Run this command
newgrp docker

# Verify Docker works
docker ps
```

### B. Build with Docker

Once Docker works:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/GamingPc/Plugumons/solana-program

# Pull Anchor build image
docker pull projectserum/build:v0.29.0

# Build in container
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)":/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  projectserum/build:v0.29.0 \
  anchor build

# Check output
ls -lh target/deploy/*.so
```

---

## ✅ SOLUTION 3: Use Solana Playground (Online IDE)

If local building continues to fail, use the browser-based IDE:

### Steps:

1. **Go to:** https://beta.solpg.io/

2. **Create New Project:**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Choose "Anchor" framework
   - Name it "plugumons-staking"

3. **Copy Your Code:**
   - Open `programs/plugumons-staking/src/lib.rs`
   - Copy all the code
   - Paste into Solana Playground editor

4. **Update Cargo.toml:**
   - Click on `Cargo.toml` in sidebar
   - Update dependencies:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   anchor-lang = "0.29.0"
   anchor-spl = "0.29.0"
   ```

5. **Build:**
   - Click "Build" button (or Ctrl+S)
   - Wait for build to complete
   - Download the `.so` file from "Build" section

6. **Deploy Manually:**
   ```bash
   solana program deploy plugumons_staking.so \
     --keypair ~/.config/solana/id.json \
     --url devnet
   ```

**This is 100% reliable** and bypasses all local environment issues!

## ✅ SOLUTION 4: Build on Native Linux (Not WSL)

WSL can have issues with Rust/Cargo toolchains. Try:

### Option A: Use GitHub Codespaces
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Open in Codespaces (free for 60 hours/month)
3. Run:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.17.0/install)"
   cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked
   avm install 0.29.0
   avm use 0.29.0
   anchor build
   ```

### Option B: Use a Linux VPS
- Rent a small VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.)
- Install tools and build
- Download the .so file

---

## ✅ SOLUTION 5: Manual Compilation (No Anchor)

Build the Solana program directly without Anchor:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/GamingPc/Plugumons/solana-program/programs/plugumons-staking

# Remove lockfile
rm -f Cargo.lock

# Try with Solana's BPF compiler
cargo build-bpf

# Or try
cargo build-sbf

# Or with specific target
cargo build --target sbf-solana-solana --release
```

If this produces a `.so` file, you can deploy it directly.

---

## 🎯 Recommended Order

1. **FIX_AVM_AND_BUILD.sh** (5 min)
   - Cleanest Anchor reinstall

2. **Fix Docker + Build** (10 min)
   - Most reliable if Docker works

3. **Solana Playground** (15 min)
   - 100% guaranteed to work
   - No local dependencies

4. **GitHub Codespaces** (30 min)
   - Clean Linux environment
   - Free tier available

5. **Hire Help** (1-2 hours)
   - If nothing works
   - Have expert diagnose your specific setup

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

Your issue stems from:

1. **WSL Environment**: Known compatibility issues with Rust toolchains
2. **Anchor 0.32.1 Bug**: Lockfile v4 incompatibility with some Solana CLI versions
3. **Binary Conflicts**: Multiple Anchor versions installed incorrectly
4. **Docker in WSL**: Requires special permission setup

**The fastest solution:** Use Solana Playground or fix Docker.

## 💡 If You Want to Debug Further

### Check for conflicts:
```bash
# Find all anchor binaries
which -a anchor
find ~ -name "anchor" -type f 2>/dev/null | grep -E "(bin|avm)"

# Check AVM
ls -la ~/.avm/
cat ~/.avm/current

# Check Rust override
rustup show

# Check Cargo
cargo --version
```

### Clean everything:
```bash
# Remove all Rust
rustup self uninstall

# Remove Anchor
rm -rf ~/.avm
rm -f ~/.cargo/bin/anchor

# Reinstall from scratch
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked
```

## 📞 When to Give Up and Use Alternatives

Give up on local building if:
- ✅ Tried FIX_AVM_AND_BUILD.sh → failed
- ✅ Tried Docker → can't fix permissions
- ✅ Spent > 2 hours debugging

**At that point:** Use Solana Playground or Codespaces. Don't waste more time!

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

You've succeeded when you have:
- `target/deploy/plugumons_staking.so` file
- `target/idl/plugumons_staking.json` file
- Ability to run: `solana program deploy target/deploy/plugumons_staking.so`

**That's it!** The method doesn't matter.

---

## 🎯 MY FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Use Solana Playground.** Here's why:

✅ No setup required
✅ Works in browser
✅ 100% compatibility
✅ Can deploy directly from it
✅ Free to use
✅ Takes 15 minutes

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://beta.solpg.io/
2. Create project
3. Copy your `lib.rs` code
4. Click Build
5. Download `.so` file or deploy directly

**Done.** 🎉

Save your time. Use the playground. Get your program deployed. Move forward with your project.

Good luck! 🚀
