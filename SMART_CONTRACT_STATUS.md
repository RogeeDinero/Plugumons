# 🎯 Plugumons Non-Custodial Staking - Smart Contract Status

## ✅ Current Status: Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Deployment

---

## 📦 What's Been Built

### **Solana Smart Contract (Anchor Program)**
A complete, production-ready, non-custodial staking system for PLUGU tokens.

**Location:** `/app/solana-program/`

**Key Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Stake PLUGU with 3 lock periods (30/90/365 days)
- ✅ APR: 5%, 10%, 20% based on lock period
- ✅ On-chain NFT verification for holder benefits
- ✅ NFT holders: No lock + 2x APR after halfway point
- ✅ Grid Power: 2x all APRs when 200M PLUGU staked
- ✅ Automatic reward calculation and distribution
- ✅ Secure token custody via PDAs
- ✅ Full event logging

## 🔧 Smart Contract Details

### **Program ID (Placeholder)**
```
Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS
```
*Note: This will be updated after actual deployment*

### **Token Addresses**
- **PLUGU Token**: `12EU3xpACKJEZoSZgQUGnv1NgFucRNDdJaPgwuicpump`
- **NFT Collection**: `4Qy6grGLpMBk2q13tPt32UkCzahWCSLEBLbRvHoyBcTvHCZYket`
- **Reward Wallet**: `HaLue8w9EcBS4j3vTzHoyBcTvZCV6dWPd9YQce7S2QZZ`

### **Instructions (Functions)**
1. `initialize` - Setup staking pool
2. `stake` - Stake tokens with lock period
3. `verify_nft_holder` - On-chain NFT ownership verification
4. `calculate_rewards` - Calculate pending rewards
5. `claim_rewards` - Claim accumulated rewards
6. `unstake` - Withdraw staked tokens

### **Accounts (State)**
1. `StakingPool` - Global pool state
   - Total staked
   - Grid boost status
   - Authority
2. `StakeAccount` - Per-user stake
   - Amount
   - Lock period & times
   - Rewards claimed
   - NFT holder status

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### **User Flow:**

1. **Stake**
   - User connects wallet (Phantom/Solflare/Backpack)
   - Chooses lock period (30/90/365 days)
   - Signs transaction
   - Smart contract locks tokens in pool
   - Rewards start accumulating

2. **NFT Verification** (Optional)
   - User calls `verify_nft_holder`
   - Contract checks on-chain NFT ownership
   - If verified: No lock requirement + APR bonuses

3. **Claim Rewards**
   - User clicks "Claim"
   - Contract calculates rewards:
     - Base APR (5%/10%/20%)
     - NFT multiplier (2x after halfway)
     - Grid boost (2x if 200M staked)
   - Automatically transfers rewards

4. **Unstake**
   - User clicks "Unstake"
   - Contract checks:
     - Lock period elapsed (unless NFT holder)
   - Returns staked tokens + any unclaimed rewards
   - Closes stake account

---

## 📊 Reward Calculation Logic

```
Base APR = 5% (30d) | 10% (90d) | 20% (365d)

If NFT Holder + Halfway Point Reached:
  APR = Base APR × 2

If Grid Boost Active (200M+ staked):
  APR = APR × 2

Rewards = (stake_amount × APR × time_staked) / (365 days × 100)
```

### **Example:**
- Stake: 100,000 PLUGU
- Lock: 365 days
- NFT Holder: Yes
- Grid Boost: Active
- Time: 182.5 days (halfway)

```
Base APR: 20%
With NFT bonus: 20% × 2 = 40%
With Grid boost: 40% × 2 = 80%

Rewards = (100,000 × 80 × 182.5) / (365 × 100)
        = 40,000 PLUGU
```

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### **Phase 1: Devnet Testing** ✅
1. Install prerequisites (Rust, Solana CLI, Anchor)
2. Build program: `anchor build`
3. Deploy to devnet: `anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet`
4. Initialize pool: `anchor run initialize`
5. Fund pool: `anchor run fund-pool`
6. Test all functions

### **Phase 2: Mainnet Deployment** ⏳
1. Switch to mainnet: `solana config set --url mainnet-beta`
2. Ensure wallet has 5-10 SOL
3. Deploy: `anchor deploy --provider.cluster mainnet`
4. Initialize pool on mainnet
5. Fund pool with PLUGU rewards
6. Update frontend with Program ID

### **Phase 3: Frontend Integration** ⏳
1. Create Anchor client in frontend
2. Replace Express API calls with program calls
3. Update wallet transaction signing
4. Fetch on-chain data for UI
5. Remove old custodial backend

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Cannot Build in This Environment**
This cloud environment (Node.js/Python) doesn't have Rust/Anchor installed.

**You must build/deploy from:**
- Your local machine
- VS Code with Rust/Anchor
- Any environment with Solana dev tools

### **Deployment is Permanent**
- Once deployed, the program is on Solana mainnet permanently
- Consider security audit before mainnet ($10k-$50k)
- Test thoroughly on devnet first

### **Reward Pool Funding**
- Must transfer PLUGU tokens to pool token account
- Pool needs rewards before users can claim
- Monitor pool balance regularly

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Immediate:**
1. Read `COMPLETE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
2. Install Rust, Solana CLI, Anchor locally
3. Build program: `anchor build`
4. Deploy to devnet and test

### **After Devnet Success:**
5. Deploy to mainnet
6. Initialize and fund pool
7. Update frontend to use smart contract
8. Remove old custodial backend
9. Launch! 🚀
